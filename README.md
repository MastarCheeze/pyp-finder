# CAIE Past Year Paper Finder 🔍

🌐 Website: https://mastarcheeze.github.io/pyp-finder/ \
📚 GitHub repository of API: https://github.com/MastarCheeze/pyp-finder-api

## Synopsis

This website finds past CAIE exam papers (IGCSE, O Levels and A Levels) using their paper code. It opens the exam
paper PDF file directly in a new tab.

I made this because I got tired of having to manually search for exam papers in a search engine and clicking
through a dozen links before getting the PDF I want.

## API

Website uses an API to find exam papers. The API is hosted using Google Cloud Run and is available for public use. For
more information, click the link to the API repository above.

(Note: The `backend` folder is obsolete and has been replaced with the new API in that separate repository.)
